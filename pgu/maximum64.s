# PURPOSE:  This program finds the maximum number of a
#           set of data items.
#

# VARIABLES: The registers have the following uses:
#
#   %r8 - Holds the index of the data item being examined
#   %rdi - Largest data item found
#   %rax - Current data item
#
#   The following memory locations are used:
#
#   data_items - contains the item data. A 0 is used
#                to terminate the data
#
